            emissions - buildings. By providing more information about some of
            the city's largest and most polluting buildings, we hope to
            encourage these buildings to electrify, particularly by mobilizing
            people related to the building - whether that be students and
            faculty for a college building or employees and patients at a
            hospital.

        In simple terms, because we can scalably produce electricity without
        emitting CO<sub>2</sub> and exacerbating the climate crisis. In fact,
        <em>this decade</em> (the 2020s) is an especially crucial one for
        tackling climate change (<a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/climate/global-warming-ipcc-earth.html"
        >
          &ldquo;World Has Less Than a Decade to Stop Catastrophic
          Warming&hellip;&rdquo; | The New York Times </a
        >), and shifting away from burning fossil fuels to using electricity
        <strong>today</strong> is a crucial step in that journey.
      </p>

      <p class="constrained">
        Even better,
        <strong>
          Illinois' grid in particular is already powered mostly by carbon-free
          energy
        </strong>
        and is improving every year!
      </p>

      <p>
        This means that buildings using only electricity cause less emissions
        every year as the power grid is moved to carbon-free sources, without
        any further changes to the building. On the other hand, fossil-fuel
        powered appliances will continue to emit as long as they are used.
