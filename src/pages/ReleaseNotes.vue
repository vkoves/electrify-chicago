        <h2>March 14th, 2025 - Building Grades v1</h2>

        <p>
          We wanted to make buildings more easy to understand at a glance, so
          you can quickly see if a building is a top performer or highly
          polluting. After months of hard work, we released our first version of
          building grades, based off of emissions intensity, energy mix, and
          consistent reporting.

          August 30th, 2024 - New Visualizations for Historic Changes & Energy
          Mix
        </h2>

        <p>
          We added new graphs to help visualize how buildings have changed in
          their emissions, emissions intensity, and energy use over time, and a
          new pie chart that shows the mix of types of energy a building
          consumes, making it easy to see at a glance if a building is mostly
          using electricity, fossil gas, or something else!

        <h2>April 2nd, 2024 - Data Update to 2022</h2>

        <p>
          Updated the source data to the year 2022, and dropped the filter
          limiting buildings to the latest year on most pages, so that dirty
          buildings that didn't report in 2022 still show up on our largest
          emitter lists.

          <strong
            >Buildings shown that have old data now use a mantel clock emoji
            (üï∞Ô∏è)</strong
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>August 30th, 2023 - Data Update to 2021</h2>

        <p>
          Updated the source data to the year 2021, which prevents being able to
          access 2020 data (for now) but also adds all reported buildings,
          removing the filter for emissions > 1,000 tons. Additionally,
          buildings that did <em>not</em> report in 2020 will have their latest
          year of data shown, so only buildings with data in 2020 and 2021 have
          data loss.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will be working on showing historical data, including comparisons,
          in a future update.
