            Electrify Chicago gives buildings letter grades from A to F based on
            their environmental performance. Learn how we calculate these
            grades, what they mean, and why we think grading buildings helps
            drive transparency and improvement in Chicago's building emissions.

            Qualitatively, some readers have reported that buildings who report
            high levels of emissions seem to stop reporting. This blog post
            looks at the data to determine if there is a pattern in the data
            that links high emitting buildings to non-reporting. We find that
            despite anecdotal observations, there seems to be no pattern for
            buildings that have higher GHG intensities in the prior year or
            upwardly trending GHG intensities to stop reporting the following
            year.

            The City of Chicago didn't fully enforce the benchmarking ordinance
            that requires the owners of large building to report their emissions
            - and based on the fine amounts laid out in the ordinance, we
            calculated the city missed out on millions and harmed transparency
            and accountability.
