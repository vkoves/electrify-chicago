      Top {{ $static.allBuilding.edges.length }} Buildings by Greenhouse Gas
      Emissions
    </h1>

    <p class="constrained -wide">
      These buildings are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases in Chicago,
      both directly (like by burning fossil gas on site for heating) and
      indirectly (by using electricity that is still produced with some fossil
      fuels).
    </p>

    <p class="constrained -wide">
      Many of these buildings are very large, which is a big part of why they
      use so much energy and have such high emissions. Several of these
      buildings, however, are not that large, but are instead incredibly
      inefficient - they use a lot of energy to heat and cool relatively small
      buildings.

      Curious to see buildings sorted by their emissions
      <em>intensity</em> instead?
