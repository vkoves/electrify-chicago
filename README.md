# Electrify Chicago

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d777babe-6135-45a1-99dd-6377999b6127/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/radiant-cucurucho-d09bae/deploys)

A site to publicize some of the most polluting buildings based on the Chicago Energy Benchmarking data published in the City of Chicago Data Portal.

Front-end in [VueJS 2](https://v2.vuejs.org/), statically built with [GridSome](https://gridsome.org/). Data processing with Python, and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

## Data Import

Our data is only sourced from the city's benchmarking data:

- [Chicago Energy Benchmarking Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Chicago-Energy-Benchmarking/xq83-jr8c/about_data)

### Cleanup

GraphQL requires data key names to have no spaces or special characters, so there's a raw data file (only filtered by GHG emissions > 1,000 tons and year = 2020) and a cleaned file that just hast he headers renamed for GraphQL.

## Tools

[python](https://www.python.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
for data processing

[Leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet) and [Leaflet Google mutant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet.gridlayer.googlemutant) for maps (e.g. the map page)

## Environment setup

### **1. Set up Docker**

Docker is the recommended approach to quickly getting started with local development. Docker helps create a version of the Electrify Chicago website on your computer so you can test out your code before submitting a pull request.

- The recommended installation method for your operating system can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
- [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

### **2. Start Docker**

This command starts server locally. To start it, `cd` into the project directory in your terminal then run the following command:

```bash
 docker-compose up
```

**Tip:** Added a new dependency? Once you've updated the `package.json` run
`docker-compose up --build` to rebuild the image, which will re-run the setup steps in the
`Dockerfile`.

Running the above command will result in the following output in your terminal

</details>

When you see the above output, it means the site is now running and now you can browse to http://localhost:8080

### **3. Stop Docker**

- To stop and completely remove the server (i.e. the running Docker container), run `docker-compose down`
- To stop the server, but not destroy it (often sufficient for day-to-day work), run `docker-compose stop`
- Bring the same server back up later with `docker-compose up`

## Commands

### Run Front-End Linting

To run linting with auto-fixing (ESLint + Prettier), run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm electrify-chicago yarn lint-fix
```

### Run Data Processing

1. If you update the raw data CSVs or the data scripts that post-process them (like if you are adding
   a new statistical analysis), you need to re-run the data processing.

2. To then process a new CSV file (at `src/data/source/ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.csv`), you need to run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm electrify-chicago python3 run_all.py
```

### Run Data Processing Tests

1. Make sure test data is created/replaced before running tests by running the following script (it will overwrite the existing test data file if it exists):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm electrify-chicago bash create_test_data.sh
```

2. To run all tests in the project directory, enter the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm electrify-chicago python -m pytest
```

3. Run the following command for individual unit test suite (where YOUR_FILE_NAME is something like
   `test_clean_all_years`):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm electrify-chicago python -m pytest tests/data/scripts/unit/YOUR_FILE_NAME.py
```

## Running Python Scripts Locally

If you want to run Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks locally outside of Docker, you should use a Python virtual environment. To see how to set up a Python virtual environment and manage Python dependencies, see our Python dev guide at [PythonDev.md](PythonDev.md).

## Managing The Data

### Adding a Building Owner

If there's a new large building owner to add, simply:

1. **Add the building owner in the `BuildingOwners` constant** in `buildings-custom-info.constant.vue` -
   this defines metadata about the owner like their name and logo URLs

Example:

```ts
iit: {
  key: 'iit',
  name: 'Illinois Institute of Technology',
  nameShort: 'Illinois Tech',
  logoSmall: '/building-owners/iit/logo-small.png',
  logoLarge: '/building-owners/iit/logo-large.svg',
}
```

2. **Tag buildings they own in the `BuildingsCustomInfo` constant** (in the same
   `buildings-custom-info.constant.vue` file) - this associates a given building (by its numeric unique
   ID, found under its address on its details page), with a given owner.

Example:

```ts
// Keating Hall
'256434': {owner: BuildingOwners.iit.key},
```

3. **Setup their route by adding the new owner's ID (key) to `BuildingOwnerIds`** (in
   `gridsome.server.js`) - this tells Gridsome to create a route for this given slug

Example:

```ts
const BuildingOwnerIds = [
  'iit',
  // ...
];
```

**Note:** You'll have to restart your `yarn develop` after step 3 to see changes, since
`gridsome.server.js` just runs once.

### Adding Building Images

1. \*_Find A Suitable Image_ -- Building images can be sourced from Google Maps or a source that allows redistribution, like
   Wikimedia.

2 **Process the Image**

We should reasonably crop images if needed and then scale them to be EITHER:

- 1000px wide if it's a landscape image
- 600px wide if it's a portrait image

Make sure to export it as a `.jpg` image at a **quality level of 70**, which should ensure a reasonable
file size under 200 kB.

\*\*Store the image in `/static/building-imgs/`.

3. **Tell The Site There's a Building Image** - Follow the pattern of other buildings in the
   `building-images.constant.vue`, providing an attribution URL, the image file name, and specify
   whether it's a tall (portrait) image and whether it's from Google Maps.

4. **Confirm the image is visible and looks good** - and that's all there is to it!

### Handling Duplicate Nodes Errors

When Gridsome builds, if you see an error like:

```sh
Building > Failed to add node: Duplicate key for property path: /building/salvation-army/
```

Add the building slug (the unique piece of the URL, e.g `salvation-army`) and add it to the
`duplicateSlugs` array in `gridsome.server.js`. By doing this, when the build process sees this
slug, it'll append the building ID to generate a unique URL. This happens when multiple buildings
have the same name, like "Salvation Army" in our example (which has multiple locations, and doesn't
specify their location in the title).

## Deploys

This site deploys automatically via Netlify by running `gridsome build`.
